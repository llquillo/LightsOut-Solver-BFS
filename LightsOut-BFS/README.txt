Description: A java Lights Out game that inputs a map (puzzle.in)
and outputs a solution for the puzzle.in map in text file
(puzzle.out). The solution is acquired using the Breadth First Search
(BFS) algorithm and that algorithm in this program gives us the
location of the different grids/buttons to be pressed in order
to solve the game in the right order.
